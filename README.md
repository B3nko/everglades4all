# everglades4all
The public rep for the everglades project, which will let everyone have access to updates we make

### Change view settings
There are 3 settings: the view, debug, and createOut

```view = 1```

The view setting creates a view in the terminal of the % control on each node as the agents move

```debug = 1``` 

The debug setting prints out most important statistics form the game to the screen

```createOut = 1``` 

The createOut setting lets the game create telemetry data (you don't always want this because it takes up a lot of storage)

### To run
On linux
```python3 battle.py```

On windows
```python battle.py```
